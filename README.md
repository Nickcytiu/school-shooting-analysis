The main goal of this project is to determine the trends if any in number of school shootings in US and the correlation it has with various factors such as 
population and median income. Data were collected through webscraping wikipedia and analyzed through BigQuery. Through exploratory anaylsis, it was concluded
that the number of school shootings in the US had increased exponetially in the past decade. However, the fataility rate has gone from around 75% from 1990s to
57% in the 2000s, and 35% in the 2010s. The results also showed that as the population of a state increases, the number of school shooting increases in a linear
fashion, with the state of California, being the most populated state, having the most number of shooting in total (roughly 10% of the entire US) dating back 
from 1840s to present day. The full findings from this anaylsis is compiled into a dashboard, the link is attached below. Thank you for your time.
